# Chicago Environmental Justice Communities Map


This is a visualization the US EPA EnviroScreen data for Chicago in 2019. The EnviroScreen metric combines environmental and demographic data into a single, easy to use metric for identifying environmental justice communities.

> Census tracts are ranked for 11 environmental and 8 demographic indicators, a resulting percentile score is then found for each tract. The percentile scores are then averaged, resulting in an environmental and demographic score for each tract.  The two averages are multiplied together to determine the *EnviroScore*.

The environmental indicators are:

1. National Scale Air Toxics Assessment Air Toxics Cancer Risk
2. National Scale Air Toxics Assessment Respiratory Hazard Index
3. National Scale Air Toxics Assessment Diesel PM (DPM)
4. Particulate Matter (PM2.5)
5. Ozone
6. Lead Paint Indicator
7. Traffic Proximity and Volume
8. Proximity to Risk Management Plan Sites
9. Proximity to Treatment Storage and Disposal Facilities
10. Proximity to National Priorities List Sites
11. Proximity to Major Direct Water Dischargers

The demographic indicators are:

1. Percent low-income
2. Percent minority
3. Less than high school education
4. Linguistic isolation
5. Individuals under age 5
6. Individuals over age 64
